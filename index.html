<h1>Important concepts from Stage 0</h1>
<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<p>The WWW is a collection of HTML documents. HTML can contain anything: 
images, videos, music, hyperlinks, etc. HTML glues everything together.</p>
<p>The WWW was created in the early 90s and now contains more than 30 billion
pages.
</p>
<p></p>This nice <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828
673/e-48230539/m-48742046">video</a> explains this very well.</p>
<b>Major Concepts of the web</b>
<p>When you visit a website, your computer browser sends an HTTP request to a
  server. A server is a computer that is optimized to host files while it sits
  in a closet. The server finds the HTML document and returns it to your
  computer. Your computer browser is able to interpret the HTML code and
  translate it to what you see on your computer.
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stand for Hypertext Markup Language. The <b>text</b> is the content 
you see, while the <b>markup</b> defines how the text will look like. HTML 
can contain reference to other documents as well as links to other pages</p>
<b>HTML markup</b>
<p>HTML markup defines how the text will look like. It contains:<br>
  - An opening tag<br>
  - The content<br>
  - A closing tab<br>
  Some useful tags include the <b>bold</b> (b) tag and the <em>emphasis 
  tag</em> (em)
</p>
<b>HTML attributes</b>
<p>Tags can have multiple attributes. Attributes have names and values. 
  An example is the "anchor" tag. The anchor tag is useful to introduce
  links to other pages. <a href="www.reddit.com">This</a> hyperlink directs
  you to www.reddit.com.
</p>
<p>If you want to embed images in your website, you can use the image tag:<br>
<img src="url" alt="Image not available"></p>
<p>You have to take into account that the image tag is a <b>void</b> tag. That
means that it has no content.
</p>
<p>Then we have to distinguish between inline tags and block tags. For example, there
  are two ways we can break a line in HTML. One is using the <b>br</b> tag, which is 
  an <em>inline tag</em>. This tag breaks the line and that's it
</p>
<p>The other way is by using a <b>p</b> tag. This tag make an <em>invisible box</em> 
  that surrounds the content.
